# secops-lab-001-azure-vm-lockdown
Deployed and secured a Linux VM on Azure. Implemented manual SSH lockdown using NSG rules as Just-In-Time access alternative.
SecOps Lab 001 â€“ SSH Lockdown on Azure Linux VM
Objective
This lab was focused on deploying a Linux virtual machine in Azure using free-tier resources and securing access by manually controlling SSH availability. Since the Just-In-Time access feature wasn't supported for the VM I used, I simulated that behavior by managing the Network Security Group (NSG) rules directly.

Azure Setup
Created a resource group named SecLab-RG
Deployed an Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS VM using the B1ls size (free-tier eligible)
Enabled auto-shutdown to prevent accidental charges
Allowed SSH (port 22) temporarily during setup
After accessing the VM, I deleted the NSG rule that allowed SSH to simulate a Just-In-Time access control scenario

Local Machine Actions (Windows)
Used Windows Command Prompt to connect via SSH:
ssh secadmin@98.71.32.31
Successfully logged into the VM and confirmed it was running as expected
Logged out of the session using the exit command
Attempted to reconnect and received a timeout error, confirming that the NSG rule had successfully blocked SSH access
